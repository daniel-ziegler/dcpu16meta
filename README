A DCPU-16 emulator, running in DCPU-16!

Paste your program onto the bottom after the :program label, assemble, and run.

NOTE: Only tested on my own emulator/assembler

TODO:
 * Better comments
 * More documentation
 * Optimization, both for speed and for size (right now it's around 70 cycles per instruction & 344 words long)
 * (more TODOs in code)
